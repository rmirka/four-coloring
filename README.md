# four-coloring

To change the file/graphs being colored by the algorithms: change the file name in line 278.
Depending on the file's format, the toggle in line 276 may need to be changed accordingly.
To change the coloring heuristic being implemented: change the toggle in line 277.

The precision value (currently set to .001) in lines 157,172,and 203 may be modified to improve coloring results. For graphs with more vertices (13/14), lessening the required precision (i.e. changing to value to ~.015) results in more successful graph colorings.
